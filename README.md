# Blog Application

The purpose of this blog app was originally to create a place for myself to post all of my thoughts but I have since decided to keep these thoughts to myself and just use it as a good portfolio piece to showcase the work I did with AWS.

## AWS Technologies:
* Elastic Beanstalk
* Route 53
* DynamoDB
* Codepipeline
* IAM and Organizations

## Web Technologies
* Bootstrap
* Express
* EJS

If you're interested in seeing the website the link is http://zacswordvomit.com though please keep in mind that the formatting and spacing will be off. I decided to accept it as imperfectly perfect for the time being and spend my time learning other things.
